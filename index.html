<p>I'd like us to practice some healthy living today. </p>
    <h1>healthy eating</h1>
        <p>Let's beggin by summarizing this as <em>a healthy gut is a healthy body.</em> It has odten been said that we
        are what we eat. Here are some of the foods that will surely promote your gut health while ensuring you stay not
        only satiated but also having many essential nutrients</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>carrots</li>
                <li>eggplant</li>
                <li>cauliflower</li>
                <li>bok choy</li>
                <li>lettuce</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Try incorporating those into your daily meals and you'll surely thank yourself with time.</p>
    
    <h1>Exercising</h1>
        <p>Apart from ensuring you stay fit and avoid complecations that come with not being so, exercising helps us build
            muscle endurance, enhance mobility and most importantly, tone our bodies so we can feel more confident in them. oh exercising will also elevate your mood and help in stress management.
            use these tools while exercising for maximum results

    <h1>keeping track</h1>
        <p>It is at times challanging to maintain discipline in eating healthy and exercising. This is why we have a community to help each other stay on track. I'll give an example of the people that
            have benefitted form the community.
